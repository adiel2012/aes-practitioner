\section{What is Cloud Computing?}

\subsection{Definition}
Cloud computing is the \textbf{on-demand delivery} of IT resources over the Internet with \textbf{pay-as-you-go pricing}. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you access technology services on an as-needed basis.

  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Benefit from massive economies of scale}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item AWS achieves higher economies of scale
    \item Lower pay-as-you-go prices
    \item Prices decrease over time
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Stop guessing capacity}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Scale up or down based on demand

  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Retain}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Keep applications on-premises
    \item Not ready to migrate
    \item Hybrid deployment
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Domain 2: Security and Compliance (30\%)}

\section{AWS Shared Responsibility Model}

\begin{important}
This is one of the most critical concepts for the exam. Understand what AWS manages versus what the customer manages.
\end{important}

\subsection{AWS Responsibility: Security OF the Cloud}
AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all services:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Physical security of data centers
  \item Hardware and networking components
  \item Compute, storage, database, and networking infrastructure
  \item AWS global infrastructure (Regions, Availability Zones, Edge Locations)
  \item Managed services (RDS, DynamoDB, etc.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Customer Responsibility: Security IN the Cloud}
Customers are responsible for:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Customer data
  \item Platform, applications, Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  \item Operating system, network, and firewall configuration
  \item Client-side data encryption and data integrity authentication
  \item Server-side encryption (file system and/or data)
  \item Network traffic protection (encryption, integrity, identity)
  \item Security group configuration
  \item User access management
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Shared Controls}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Patch Management: AWS patches infrastructure; customers patch OS and applications
  \item Configuration Management: AWS configures infrastructure; customers configure databases and applications
  \item Awareness and Training: AWS trains employees; customers train their staff
\end{itemize}

\begin{examtip}
For any security question, ask: "Who is responsible?" AWS handles the infrastructure; you handle what you put in the cloud.
\end{examtip}

\section{AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)}

\subsection{Core Components}

\subsubsection{Users}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Individual people or services
  \item Permanent named operators
  \item Can have long-term credentials (password, access keys)
  \item Should represent a physical person or application
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Groups}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Collection of users
  \item Groups cannot be nested
  \item Users can belong to multiple groups
  \item Apply policies to groups for easier management
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Roles}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Temporary credentials for users, applications, or services
  \item No username/password or access keys
  \item Can be assumed by anyone who needs it
  \item Best practice for EC2 instances accessing AWS services
  \item Can be used for cross-account access
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Policies}
\begin{itemize}
  \item JSON documents defining permissions
  \item Attached to users, groups, or roles
  \item Define what actions are allowed or denied
  \item Follow principle of least privilege
\end{itemize}

\subsection{IAM Best Practices}

  \item \textbf{Root account}: Use only for initial setup, then lock it away
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Enable MFA on root account
    \item Do not create access keys for root
    \item Create individual IAM users
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Principle of Least Privilege}: Grant only permissions required

  \item \textbf{Use Groups}: Assign permissions to groups, not individual users

  \item \textbf{Enable MFA}: Especially for privileged users

  \item \textbf{Use Roles}: For applications running on EC2

  \item \textbf{Rotate Credentials}: Regularly change passwords and access keys

  \item \textbf{Remove Unnecessary Credentials}: Delete unused users, roles, and access keys

  \item \textbf{Use Policy Conditions}: For extra security (IP restrictions, time-based, MFA)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)}

MFA adds extra layer of protection:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Something you know (password)
  \item Something you have (MFA device)
  \item MFA device options:
  \begin{itemize}

\section{Test-Taking Strategies}

\subsection{Before the Exam}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Review all exam objectives}: Ensure you've covered each domain
  \item \textbf{Take practice exams}: Identify weak areas
  \item \textbf{Get hands-on experience}: Create AWS account, experiment with services
  \item \textbf{Review AWS documentation}: Especially FAQs for key services
  \item \textbf{Get adequate rest}: Sleep well before exam day
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{During the Exam}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Read questions carefully}: Pay attention to keywords
  \begin{itemize}
    \item "MOST cost-effective"
    \item "BEST"
    \item "LEAST amount of effort"
    \item "NOT" or "EXCEPT"
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Eliminate wrong answers}: Narrow down choices

  \item \textbf{Watch for absolutes}: "Always," "never," "all," "none" are often wrong

  \item \textbf{Flag difficult questions}: Return to them later

  \item \textbf{Manage time}: Don't spend too long on one question

  \item \textbf{Trust your preparation}: Your first instinct is often correct

  \item \textbf{Use process of elimination}: Remove obviously incorrect answers

  \item \textbf{Review flagged questions}: Use remaining time to review
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Common Question Patterns}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Scenario-based}: Describe situation, ask for best solution
  \item \textbf{Select TWO/THREE}: Multiple correct answers
  \item \textbf{Best practice}: What's the recommended approach?
  \item \textbf{Cost optimization}: Which option is most cost-effective?
  \item \textbf{Security}: Which option is most secure?
  \item \textbf{High availability}: Which design ensures uptime?
\end{itemize}

\section{Common Pitfalls to Avoid}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Confusing service names}: EC2 vs. ECS vs. EKS; S3 vs. EBS vs. EFS
  \item \textbf{Not understanding Shared Responsibility}: Know what AWS vs. customer manages
  \item \textbf{Mixing up support plans}: Especially response times and TAM
  \item \textbf{Forgetting storage classes}: S3 storage tiers and use cases
  \item \textbf{Confusing pricing models}: On-Demand vs. Reserved vs. Spot
  \item \textbf{Not knowing AWS global infrastructure}: Regions, AZs, Edge Locations
  \item \textbf{Overlooking "EXCEPT" questions}: Read carefully
  \item \textbf{Assuming real-world complexity}: Choose AWS-recommended simple solution
\end{enumerate}

\section{Key Concepts to Memorize}

\begin{examtip}
Focus on understanding concepts rather than memorization, but these facts appear frequently on the exam.
\end{examtip}

\subsection{Numbers to Remember}

\begin{itemize}
  \item S3 durability: 99.999999999\% (11 nines)
  \item Minimum AZs per Region: 3
  \item Edge Locations: 400+
  \item Lambda max execution: 15 minutes
  \item RDS read replicas: Up to 5
  \item Support plan response times
  \item Free tier: 12 months for EC2, S3, RDS
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Service Comparisons}

\begin{itemize}
  \item S3 vs. EBS vs. EFS
  \item RDS vs. DynamoDB vs. Redshift
  \item EC2 vs. Lambda vs. Elastic Beanstalk
  \item CloudWatch vs. CloudTrail vs. Config
  \item SNS vs. SQS
  \item Security Groups vs. NACLs
